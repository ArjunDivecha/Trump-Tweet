# Complete project README for Trump Analysis Pipeline

# Trump Analysis Pipeline: Market Data + Political Content

This project combines two powerful data sources for advanced analysis:

1. **Financial Data**: VXX (volatility) and SPY (S&P 500) price history from Interactive Brokers
2. **Political Content**: Donald Trump's Truth Social posts from trumpstruth.org
3. **AI Analysis**: Intelligent classification of tariff/trade discussions in Trump's posts

## üìà Financial Data Collection

### SPY ETF (S&P 500 Index) Data

**Program**: `SPY History.py` (5-minute intervals)
- **Purpose**: Fetches historical price data for SPY ETF to track market performance
- **Output**: `SPY_5min_history.xlsx` - Excel file with Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
- **Time Interval**: 5 minutes (less granular, longer history)
- **Coverage**: Up to 1 year of data (4 √ó 3-month chunks)
- **Expected Rows**: ~4,000-6,000 for 1 year
- **File Size**: ~1-2 MB

**Program**: `SPY History 1 Min.py` (1-minute intervals)
- **Purpose**: High-granularity SPY data for detailed technical analysis
- **Output**: `SPY_1min_history.xlsx` - Excel file with 1-minute OHLCV data
- **Time Interval**: 1 minute (more granular, shorter history due to API limits)
- **Coverage**: ~1 month of data (12 √ó 1-month chunks, but often limited)
- **Expected Rows**: ~18,000-25,000 for 1 month
- **File Size**: ~2-3 MB

### VXX Volatility ETF Data

**Program**: `VXX History.py` (5-minute intervals)
- **Purpose**: Fetches VXX data to track market fear/volatility alongside SPY
- **Output**: `VXX_5min_history.xlsx` - Excel file with VXX OHLCV data
- **Time Interval**: 5 minutes
- **Coverage**: Up to 1 year of data (4 √ó 3-month chunks)
- **Expected Rows**: ~4,000-6,000 for 1 year
- **File Size**: ~1-2 MB

**VXX vs SPY Analysis**:
- SPY tracks S&P 500 performance (market direction)
- VXX tracks market FEAR (volatility) - goes up when SPY goes down
- Compare both to understand when fear drives market movements

## üì∞ Political Content Collection

### Truth Social Post Scraper

**Program**: `trumpstruth_scraper_auto.py`
- **Purpose**: Automatically collects all Trump's Truth Social posts from trumpstruth.org
- **Input**: None (direct web scraping)
- **Output**:
  - `trump_truth_archive.json` - Raw scraped data (may need cleaning)
  - `trump_truth_archive.csv` - Raw scraped data (may need cleaning)
- **Coverage**: Jan 1, 2025 to present (~2,500-3,000 posts)
- **Process**: Month-by-month scraping with built-in delays (10-30 minutes runtime)
- **Log**: `trumpstruth_scraper_log.txt` - Tracks progress and any issues

### Data Cleaning

**Program**: `clean_trump_archive.py`
- **Purpose**: Cleans raw scraped data into structured format for AI analysis
- **Input**: `trump_truth_archive.json` (raw, messy data from scraper)
- **Output**:
  - `trump_truth_archive_clean.json` - Individual posts, no duplicates
  - `trump_truth_archive_clean.csv` - Clean CSV ready for analysis
  - `cleaning_log.txt` - Records what was cleaned/removed
- **What it does**:
  - Splits concatenated posts into individual entries
  - Removes website navigation text, buttons, ads
  - Eliminates duplicate posts
  - Sorts posts chronologically
  - Validates data quality
- **Expected Results**: ~2,562 unique posts (after removing ~10% duplicates/navigation)

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Tariff Analysis

**Program**: `tariff_classifier_optimized.py`
- **Purpose**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 AI to analyze posts for tariff/trade content
- **Input**: `trump_truth_archive_clean.csv` (cleaned posts from cleaning step)
- **Output**:
  - `tariff_classified_tweets.json` - Complete AI analysis with metadata
  - `tariff_classified_tweets.csv` - Excel-ready results with AI classifications
  - `classification_log.txt` - AI processing details and errors
  - `checkpoint.json` - Progress save (resume if interrupted)
- **AI Analysis Fields Added**:
  - `is_tariff_related`: True/False (does post discuss tariffs?)
  - `confidence`: 0-100 (how sure is the AI?)
  - `tariff_type`: China, Mexico, EU, BRICS, General, None
  - `countries_mentioned`: List of countries (e.g., ["China", "Mexico"])
  - `tariff_percentage`: Specific rates mentioned (e.g., "100%", "25%")
  - `sentiment`: Aggressive, Defensive, Informational, Neutral
  - `key_phrases`: Trade-related phrases (e.g., "reciprocal trade", "unfair practices")
  - `explanation`: AI's reasoning for classification

**Usage**:
```bash
# Full analysis (2,562 posts, ~$7-10, 45-60 minutes)
python3 tariff_classifier_optimized.py YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Fast analysis (pre-filter to ~200 posts, ~$1, 5-10 minutes)
python3 tariff_classifier_optimized.py YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --pre-filter

# Resume interrupted analysis
