Sending merchandise, product, or anything by any other name through another Country, for purposes of unfairly harming America, will not be accepted. In addition, we will make provision for subsidies provided by Countries in order to take Economic advantage of the United States. Likewise, provisions will be made for Nonmonetary Tariffs and Trade Barriers that some Countries charge in order to keep our product out of their domain or, if they do not even let U.S. businesses operate. We are able to accurately determine the cost of these Nonmonetary Trade Barriers. It is fair to all, no other Country can complain and, in some cases, if a Country feels that the United States would be getting too high a Tariff, all they have to do is reduce or terminate their Tariff against us. There are no Tariffs if you manufacture or build your product in the United States.For many years, the U.S. has been treated unfairly by other Countries, both friend and foe.

Today, I am honored to announce that I am nominating Air Force Lieutenant General Dan ‚ÄúRazin‚Äù Caine to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Caine is an accomplished pilot, national security expert, successful entrepreneur, and a ‚Äúwarfighter‚Äù with significant interagency and special operations experience. During my first term, Razin was instrumental in the complete annihilation of the ISIS caliphate. It was done in record setting time, a matter of weeks. Many so-called military ‚Äúgeniuses‚Äù said it would take years to defeat ISIS. General Caine, on the other hand, said it could be done quickly, and he delivered. Despite being highly qualified and respected to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the previous administration, General Caine was passed over for promotion by Sleepy Joe Biden. But not anymore! Alongside Secretary Pete Hegseth, General Caine and our military will restore peace through strength, put America First, and rebuild our military. Finally, I have also directed Secretary Hegseth to solicit nominations for five additional high level positions, which will be announced soon.

Paul, Weiss agrees that the bedrock principle of American Justice is that it must be fair and nonpartisan for all. Our Justice System is betrayed when it is misused to achieve political ends.Lawyers and law firms play a vital role in ensuring that we live up to that standard as a Nation. Law firms should not favor any political party when it comes to choosing their clients. Firms also should not make decisions on whom to hire based on a person‚Äôs political affiliation. To do otherwise is to deny some Americans an equal opportunity for our services while favoring others. Lawyers abandon the profession‚Äôs highest ideals when they engage in partisan decision-making, and betray the ethical obligation to represent those who are unpopular or disfavored in a particular environment. 2. Paul, Weiss affirms its unwavering commitment to these core ideals and principles, and will not deny representation to clients, including in pro bono matters and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers. 3. Paul, Weiss will take on a wide range of pro bono matters that represent the full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society, whether ‚Äúconservative‚Äù or ‚Äúliberal.‚Äù4. Paul, Weiss affirms its commitment to merit-based hiring, promotion, and retention, and will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies. As part of its commitment, it will engage experts, to be mutually agreed upon within 14 days, to conduct a comprehensive audit of all of its employment practices.5. Paul, Weiss will dedicate the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump‚Äôs term to support the Administration‚Äôs initiatives, including: assisting our Nation‚Äôs veterans, fairness in the Justice System, the President‚Äôs Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, and other mutually agreed projects.Statement from the White House: ‚ÄúThe President is agreeing to this action in light of a meeting with Paul, Weiss Chairman, Brad Karp, during which Mr. Karp acknowledged the wrongdoing of former Paul, Weiss partner, Mark Pomerantz, the grave dangers of Weaponization, and the vital need to restore our System of Justice.‚ÄùIn response to the President‚Äôs announcement, Paul, Weiss‚Äôs Chairman Brad Karp said: ‚ÄúWe are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss.

For this reason alone, everything he is doing is lawless. But it is much worse; it is also dangerous.Judge Boasberg ran to his courtroom to hold a Saturday hearing, even though he was not even serving as the emergency judge that weekend. (How did he get this case?) He publicly exposed an ongoing U.S. military, intelligence, and law-enforcement operation with an American ally dealing with the most vicious terrorists (Tren de Aragua) and international gang member (MS13) in the Western Hemisphere.That public exposure put American and allied lives in grave danger.Stunningly, Judge Boasberg even ordered the President to turn around planes full of terrorists over the Gulf of America, without knowing the fuel levels, the security footprint back in America, or other crucial operational details.We saw the enormous security footprint in El Salvador. Why would we have had that same footprint in America, as who could have ever imagined an activist DC judge could or would order the President to return planes full of terrorists?And not completing the mission would have humiliated and politically damaged El Salvador's president, who had hundreds of military, law-enforcement, and other officials awaiting--and who took a significant political and personal risk by agreeing to take these terrorists.Judge Boasberg's Saturday hearing and order crossed the red line. But Judge Boasberg is doubling down by demanding details about the military operation, to which he is not entitled. Judge Boasberg says he has a security clearance, but he definitely does not have the need to know. And allowing judges to meddle in military operations like this is dangerous and unacceptable.Foreign leaders are less likely to work with the President, if they fear an activist American judge may disclose their secrets. This harms the President‚Äôs ability to conduct foreign policy and his constitutional duty to keep us safe.The President has a constitutional duty, as the chief executive officer and commander-in-chief, to conduct international affairs, repeal foreign invasion, and protect American lives. The President has a constitutional duty to ignore any clearly unlawful court order that imminently endangers American lives, like Judge Boasberg's orders.Judge Boasberg is refusing to back down. So the House must move forward with impeachment proceedings for his lawless and dangerous sabotage of the President's core Article II powers.https://x.com/kyledcheney/status/1904170983352672315","March 26, 2025, 7:49 PM",2025-03-26T19:49:00,2025-03-26,@realDonaldTrump,Truth Social,2025-10-18T17:15:37.691794,,0,0,False,100,None,,,Neutral,,"|This tweet announces a CDC Director nominee, completely unrelated to tariffs or trade policy."

2025-05-13_17,"For many years the World has wondered why Prescription Drugs and Pharmaceuticals in the United States States of America were SO MUCH HIGHER IN PRICE THAN THEY WERE IN ANY OTHER NATION, SOMETIMES BEING FIVE TO TEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE SAME DRUG, MANUFACTURED IN THE EXACT SAME LABORATORY OR PLANT, BY THE SAME COMPANY??? It was always difficult to explain and very embarrassing because, in fact, there was no correct or rightful answer. The Pharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the ‚Äúsuckers‚Äù of America, ALONE. Campaign Contributions can do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party. We are going to do the right thing, something that the Democrats have fought for many years. Therefore, I am pleased to announce that Tomorrow morning, in the White House, at 9:00 A.M., I will be signing one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country‚Äôs history. Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%. They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA! I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION‚ÄôS POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.

Where do these initial three Judges come from? How is it possible for them to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is it purely a hatred of ‚ÄúTRUMP?‚Äù What other reason could it be? I was new to Washington, and it was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges. I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real ‚Äúsleazebag‚Äù named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions. He openly brags how he controls Judges, and even Justices of the United States Supreme Court ‚Äî I hope that is not so, and don‚Äôt believe it is! In any event, Leo left The Federalist Society to do his own ‚Äúthing.‚Äù I am so disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations. This is something that cannot be forgotten! With all of that being said, I am very proud of many of our picks, but very disappointed in others. They always must do what‚Äôs right for the Country! In this case, it is only because of my successful use of Tariffs that many Trillions of Dollars have already begun pouring into the U.S.A. from other Countries, money that, without these Tariffs, we would not be able to get. It is the difference between having a rich, prosperous, and successful United States of America, and quite the opposite. The ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade is so wrong, and so political! Hopefully, the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible, Country threatening decision, QUICKLY and DECISIVELY. Backroom ‚Äúhustlers‚Äù must not be allowed to destroy our Nation! The horrific decision stated that I would have to get the approval of Congress for these Tariffs. In other words, hundreds of politicians would sit around D.C. for weeks, and even months, trying to come to a conclusion as to what to charge other Countries that are treating us unfairly. If allowed to stand, this would completely destroy Presidential Power ‚Äî The Presidency would never be the same! This decision is being hailed all over the World by every Country, other than the United States of America. Radical Left Judges, together with some very bad people, are destroying America. Under this decision, Trillions of Dollars would be lost by our Country, money that will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. It would be the harshest financial ruling ever leveled on us as a Sovereign Nation.

2025-06-24_20,"Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky is not MAGA, even though he likes to say he is. Actually, MAGA doesn‚Äôt want him, doesn‚Äôt know him, and doesn‚Äôt respect him. He is a negative force who almost always Votes ‚ÄúNO,‚Äù no matter how good something may be. He‚Äôs a simple minded ‚Äúgrandstander‚Äù who thinks it‚Äôs good politics for Iran to have the highest level Nuclear weapon, while at the same time yelling ‚ÄúDEATH TO AMERICA‚Äù at every chance they get. Iran has killed and maimed thousands of Americans, and even took over the American Embassy in Tehran under the Carter Administration. We had a spectacular military success yesterday, taking the ‚Äúbomb‚Äù right out of their hands (and they would use it if they could!) but, as usual, and despite all of the praise and accolades received, this ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù Congressman is against what was so brilliantly achieved last night in Iran. Massie is weak, ineffective, and votes ‚ÄúNO‚Äù on virtually everything put before him (Rand Paul, Jr.), no matter how good something may be. He is disrespectful to our great military, and all that they stand for, not even acknowledging their brilliance and bravery in yesterday‚Äôs attack, which was a total and complete WIN. Massie should drop his fake act and start putting America First, but he doesn‚Äôt know how to get there ‚Äî he doesn‚Äôt have a clue! He‚Äôll undoubtedly vote against the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill, even though non-passage means a 68% Tax Increase for everybody, and many things far worse than that. MAGA should drop this pathetic LOSER, Tom Massie, like the plague! The good news is that we will have a wonderful American Patriot running against him in the Republican Primary, and I‚Äôll be out in Kentucky campaigning really hard. MAGA is not about lazy, grandstanding, nonproductive politicians, of which Thomas Massie is definitely one. Thank you to our incredible military for the AMAZING job they did last night.

I have been strongly opposed to that from the very beginning. People are now allowed to buy whatever they want - Gasoline Powered, Hybrids (which are doing very well), or New Technologies as they come about - No more EV Mandate. I have campaigned on this for two years and, quite honestly, when Elon gave me his total and unquestioned Endorsement, I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate - It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had. He said he had no problems with that - I was very surprised! Additionally, Elon asked that one of his close friends run NASA and, while I thought his friend was very good, I was surprised to learn that he was a blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.

The collaborators knew it was a lie, but they manipulated the Dossier and the CIA to peddle their fairy tale. Brennan and Comey manipulated the system, and the document itself. They abused their power. Comey lauched a case against Trump in violation of the FBI Regulations. He deceived the FISA Court with the Dossier to gain a Spy Warrant. John Brennan used that Dossier knowing it was GARBAGE, and he insisted it be put in the Intelligence Committee Assessment. He knew it was such a Phony Document and that if it could be put in the Intellegence Committee Assessment, it will elevate the credibility and that he could drive Trump from office. He told Congress that it wasn‚Äôt in the Assessment - WELL IT WAS! Can he be charged? YES HE CAN! They eroded confidence and trust in the American Government, particularly the FBI, CIA, and other agencies, single-handedly. THEY SET BACK AMERICA CONSIDERABLY. James Comey needs daily therapy.

2025-08-14_4,"Washington, D.C., has one of the Highest Rates of Crime in the World, more than many of the most violent Third World Countries. The City‚Äôs Homicide Rate is higher than places notorious for their violence, such as Mexico City, Bogota, Islamabad, and Addis Ababa ‚Äî Almost ten times higher than Fallujah, Iraq. If D.C. were a State, it would have the highest Homicide Rate of any State in America. The Violent Crime Rate in D.C. has worsened, and the Murder Rate has essentially DOUBLED in just over a decade ‚Äî But these are only the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù statistics released by corrupt City Officials. The REAL numbers are many times worse. In fact, a Precinct Commander was just suspended for allegedly manipulating the Violent Crime Statistics, and the D.C. Police Union, likewise, says the real numbers are much higher. Because the Democrat Government of D.C. has largely stopped investigating, arresting, and prosecuting most Crime, the published statistics don‚Äôt even capture a fraction of the actual Violence. No one is arrested for shoplifting. Citizens living in fear have largely given up on calling the Police, instead choosing not to walk the streets after dark, essentially becoming captive prisoners in their own City. Stores lock up their merchandise behind glass walls. Gang Youth Violence is so common it goes largely unreported. Vehicle Theft in D.C. is more than three times the National Average. Schools are completely dysfunctional. Citizens are afraid to speak up or, call the Police, lest they be targeted. The REAL Crime Rates are probably five to ten times what has been reported. D.C. has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now, D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs. The White House is in charge.

2025-08-21_0,"TOTAL VICTORY in the FAKE New York State Attorney General Letitia James Case! I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State. Others were afraid to do business there. The amount, including Interest and Penalties, was over $550 Million Dollars. It was a Political Witch Hunt, in a business sense, the likes of which no one has ever seen before. This was a Case of Election Interference by the City and State trying to show, illegally, that I did things that were wrong when, in fact, everything I did was absolutely CORRECT and, even, PERFECT. Every single Dollar was thrown out, even the penalties imposed on us by the Corrupt Judge, one of the most overturned in History, Arthur Engoron. I wasn‚Äôt given a Jury and, during the course of the Trial, which lasted a long time, was not given one Ruling in my favor by this Political Hack, but worse than him, if that‚Äôs possible, was Letitia James, a Corrupt and Incompetent Attorney General who only brought this Case in order to hurt me politically. She is a Trump Deranged Lunatic! They made me bond the outrageous sum, which never happened before, and which cost me Millions of Dollars a month. It should have never been allowed to happen, and everyone knew it! Importantly, the Vote was 5 to 0. I am so honored by Justice David Friedman‚Äôs great words of wisdom, which should be read by everyone. I would also like to thank the Court for having the Courage to make this Decision, which is already going down as one of the worst business persecutions in the History of our Country. Sadly, there are other Cases against me that are equally disgraceful, including those headed up by Corrupt Judges, like Juan Merchan, whose daughter collected Millions of Dollars in Fees from Crooked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, while her father shockingly REFUSED TO RECUSE himself from a vicious and corrupt trial, which is also under Appeal, one in which every Legal Pundit in New York said, ‚ÄúTHERE WAS NO CASE!‚Äù ‚Äî Even Editorial Boards said, ‚ÄúDO NOT DO THIS!‚Äù Judge Merchan gave me an unprecedented Gag Order, not letting me talk about him or his daughter, or the fact that the Appellate Judges thought he should not be doing the Case, but he did it anyway. Many Lawyers said that his daughter and him created the Greatest Conflict of Interest they had ever seen. Judge Lewis Kaplan, the other remaining Case, whose wife, family, and friends attended his two trials, is as mean and nasty as anyone I have ever met. That Case, also on Appeal, should also never have been brought, and he should be admonished for Abuse, and every other thing that can be thrown at a Corrupt Judge. He loved the publicity, and would not let us present the irrefutable evidence that we wanted to present. This Clinton appointed Judge should not be allowed to get away with this SCAM‚Ä¶.","August 21, 2025, 3:25 PM",2025-08-21T15:25:00,2025-08-21,@realDonaldTrump,Truth Social,2025-10-18T17:20:59.104237,,0,0,False,95,None,,,Neutral,,"|Not tariff-related; discusses New York AG legal case and business climate generally, no trade/tariff content"
2025-08-21_1,"‚Ä¶.These were all Political Trials in an effort to destroy my viability as a Presidential Candidate before, during, and after the Election. They were strongly coordinated with the Biden/Harris Campaign, and will go down in History as among the most Corrupt Cases ever brought. These two Cases are even more ridiculous than the Corrupt Letitia James Case, and will be found out to be so in the very near future. All of these Judges should be ashamed of themselves for allowing them to happen. They are Political Hacks who did everything possible to hurt me as a Candidate. This was an attack by the Biden/Harris Administration on their Political Opponent, ME. It is such an Honor to have withstood it, thrived, and even become President of the United States despite the horrible things that were done to me.

2025-09-14_6,"A LETTER SENT BY PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP TO ALL NATO NATIONS AND, THE WORLD: ‚ÄúI am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA. As you know, NATO‚ÄôS commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to ‚Äúgo‚Äù when you are. Just say when? I believe that this, plus NATO, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR. China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip. This is not TRUMP‚ÄôS WAR (it would never have started if I was President!), it is Biden‚Äôs and Zelenskyy‚Äôs WAR. I am only here to help stop it, and save thousands of Russian and Ukrainian lives (7,118 lives lost last week, alone. CRAZY!). If NATO does as I say, the WAR will end quickly, and all of those lives will be saved! If not, you are just wasting my time, and the time, energy, and money of the United States.

First, the escalator going up to the Main Speaking Floor came to a screeching halt. It stopped on a dime. It‚Äôs amazing that Melania and I didn‚Äôt fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first. It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster. This was absolutely sabotage, as noted by a day‚Äôs earlier ‚Äúpost‚Äù in The London Times that said UN workers ‚Äújoked about turning off an escalator.‚Äù The people that did it should be arrested! Then, as I stood before a Television crowd of millions of people all over the World, and important Leaders in the Hall, my teleprompter didn‚Äôt work. It was stone cold dark. I immediately thought to myself, ‚ÄúWow, first the escalator event, and now a bad teleprompter. What kind of a place is this?‚Äù I then proceeded to make a Speech without a teleprompter, which kicked in about 15 minutes later. The good news is the Speech has gotten fantastic reviews. Maybe they appreciated the fact that very few people could have done what I did. And third, after making the Speech, I was told that the sound was completely off in the Auditorium where the Speech was made, that World Leaders, unless they used the interpreters‚Äô earpieces, couldn‚Äôt hear a thing. The first person I saw at the conclusion of the Speech was Melania, who was sitting right up front. I said, ‚ÄúHow did I do?‚Äù And she said, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt hear a word you said.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.

2025-10-13_10,"It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them. This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","October 13, 2025, 11:31 AM",2025-10-13T11:31:00,2025-10-13,@realDonaldTrump,Truth Social,2025-10-18T17:22:32.196219,,0,0,True,100,China,China,0,Aggressive,"Export Controls, hostile letter, large scale, International Trade, moral disgrace, November 1st 2025",Directly discusses China imposing export controls on products affecting all countries - this is a trade restriction measure equivalent to tariffs
2025-10-13_11,"Some very strange things are happening in China! They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it‚Äôs not manufactured in China. Nobody has ever seen anything like this but, essentially, it would ‚Äúclog‚Äù the Markets, and make life difficult for virtually every Country in the World, especially for China. We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere. Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they‚Äôve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‚Äúcaptive,‚Äù but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‚ÄúMagnets‚Äù and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least. But the U.S. has Monopoly positions also, much stronger and more far reaching than China‚Äôs. I have just not chosen to use them, there was never a reason for me to do so ‚Äî UNTIL NOW! The letter they sent is many pages long, and details, with great specificity, each and every Element that they want to withhold from other Nations. Things that were routine are no longer routine at all. I have not spoken to President Xi because there was no reason to do so. This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World. I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so. The Chinese letters were especially inappropriate in that this was the Day that, after three thousand years of bedlam and fighting, there is PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. I wonder if that timing was coincidental? Dependent on what China says about the hostile ‚Äúorder‚Äù that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move. For every Element that they have been able to monopolize, we have two. I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come. Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A. One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DONALD J.

As everyone remembers, ‚ÄúDa Nang‚Äù stated for almost twenty years that he was a proud Vietnam Veteran, having endured the worst of the War, watching the Wounded and Dead as he raced up the hills and down the valleys, blood streaming from his face. He was ‚Äúa Great Hero,‚Äù he would leak to any and all who would listen ‚Äî And then it happened! He was a COMPLETE AND TOTAL FRAUD. He never went to Vietnam, he never saw Vietnam, he never experienced the Battles there, or anywhere else. His War Hero status, and even minimal service in our Military, was totally and completely MADE UP. This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN! George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated. Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY.

It was my Great Honor to win North Carolina six times, including Primaries, in 2016, 2020, and 2024, and this new Map would give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections, which would be A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda, not just in North Carolina, but across our Nation. Remember, I won the Electoral College, 312-226, Counties Nationwide, 2,700 to 525, all seven Swing States (A LANDSLIDE!), and now I have the best Polling Numbers I've ever had. Our Party has never been more UNITED, and we are getting so much done for the American People because of it. Therefore, I encourage all of my Republican friends in the North Carolina Legislature to work as hard as they can to pass this new Map so that we can continue our incredible Record of SUCCESS.
