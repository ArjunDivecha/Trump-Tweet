# Tariff Classifier Updates - New Fields Added

## Summary
Updated `tariff_classifier_optimized.py` to add two new columns to the output that identify whether tweets are announcing or threatening tariffs and extract effective dates.

## New Fields Added

### 1. `tariff_action_type` (String)
Three possible values:
- **"announcing"**: Definitive statements about implementing tariffs
  - Examples: "I am imposing", "We will implement", "Effective immediately", "I have signed"
- **"threatening"**: Conditional statements about potential tariffs  
  - Examples: "If China doesn't...", "They have 30 days or face", "Unless they change"
- **"no_mention"**: Tweet doesn't announce or threaten tariffs on imports from other countries

### 2. `tariff_effective_date` (String)
Extracts specific dates mentioned for tariff implementation:
- Specific dates: "January 20, 2025", "March 1st", "February 15th"
- Relative dates: "effective immediately", "within 30 days", "on inauguration day"
- Empty string if no date mentioned

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AI Prompt (`create_classification_prompt`)
- Expanded from 9 fields to 11 fields in pipe-separated output
- Added detailed instructions for classifying action types (announcing vs threatening)
- Added instructions for extracting effective dates

### 2. Updated Parsing (`parse_classification_response`)
- Added default values for new fields: `tariff_action_type='no_mention'`, `tariff_effective_date=''`
- Added extraction logic for field 9 (action type) with validation
- Added extraction logic for field 10 (effective date)
- Shifted explanation field from position 8 to position 10

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Updated all docstrings to reflect 10 questions instead of 8
- Updated example outputs to show new fields
- Updated class-level documentation with new field descriptions

### 4. Updated Pre-filter Logic
- Pre-filtered posts now include the two new fields with default values

## Output Format

### New Pipe-Separated Format (11 fields):
```
TWEET_ID|IS_TARIFF_RELATED|CONFIDENCE|TARIFF_TYPE|COUNTRIES|PERCENTAGE|SENTIMENT|KEY_PHRASES|TARIFF_ACTION_TYPE|EFFECTIVE_DATE|EXPLANATION
```

### Example Output:
**Announcement Example:**
```
12345|TRUE|95|China|China|100%|Aggressive|100% tariffs, unfair practices|announcing|January 20, 2025|Direct China tariff announcement with specific date
```

**Threat Example:**
```
12346|TRUE|92|Mexico|Mexico|25%|Aggressive|border security, illegal immigration|threatening|within 30 days|Conditional tariff threat if border issues not resolved
```

**No Mention Example:**
```
12347|FALSE|98|None|||Neutral|||no_mention||General political commentary, no tariff content
```

## CSV/JSON Output Columns

The output files (`tariff_classified_tweets.json` and `.csv`) now include these additional columns:
- `tariff_action_type`: String ("announcing", "threatening", or "no_mention")
- `tariff_effective_date`: String (date or empty)

## Usage

The script usage remains the same. The new fields are automatically included in all outputs:

```bash
# Full analysis with new fields
python3 tariff_classifier_optimized.py YOUR_API_KEY

# Pre-filtered analysis (recommended)
python3 tariff_classifier_optimized.py YOUR_API_KEY --pre-filter --parallel
```

## Benefits for Analysis

1. **Distinguish announcements from threats**: Identify actionable tariff announcements vs. negotiating tactics
2. **Extract effective dates**: Track when threatened tariffs would take effect for market impact timing
3. **Event study preparation**: Filter for announcements with specific dates for precise market event analysis
4. **Timeline construction**: Build chronological timeline of tariff threats vs. implementations

## Example Queries After Analysis

Filter CSV for announcements with dates:
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('tariff_classified_tweets.csv')

# Get all tariff announcements with specific dates
announcements = df[
    (df['tariff_action_type'] == 'announcing') & 
    (df['tariff_effective_date'] != '')
]

# Get all threats
threats = df[df['tariff_action_type'] == 'threatening']
```

## Version
- **Previous**: 8 classification fields
- **Current**: 10 classification fields (added 2 new)
- **Date Updated**: 2025-10-20
- **Backward Compatible**: No (output format changed from 9 to 11 pipe-separated fields)

## Notes
- The AI model (Claude Sonnet 4.5) is instructed to be conservative in classifications
- Dates are extracted as mentioned in tweets (not standardized/parsed)
- Action type validation ensures only valid values: "announcing", "threatening", "no_mention"
