SENTIMENT-BASED 30-MINUTE REACTION ANALYSIS - SUMMARY
================================================================================

Date: 2025-10-20
Analysis: ALL tariff-related tweets (no filters)
Time Window: 30 minutes after tweet
Sample: 279 tariff tweets → 164 with market data

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

HYPOTHESIS: Aggressive tariff tweets cause immediate market drops
RESULT: **NOT SUPPORTED**

All three sentiment types show statistically insignificant reactions:

┌─────────────────┬──────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│ SENTIMENT       │  N   │ MEAN RETURN  │ % NEGATIVE   │ SIGNIFICANT? │
├─────────────────┼──────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Aggressive      │  39  │   +0.030%    │    38.5%     │      NO      │
│ Defensive       │   9  │   -0.015%    │    33.3%     │      NO      │
│ Informational   │  38  │   -0.079%    │    52.6%     │      NO*     │
└─────────────────┴──────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘

*Informational almost significant (p=0.0502, just above α=0.05 threshold)

DETAILED RESULTS
================================================================================

AGGRESSIVE TWEETS (N=39)
------------------------
• Mean 30-min return: +0.030%
• 61.5% had POSITIVE reactions
• Only 38.5% had negative reactions
• Standard deviation: 0.383%
• Range: -1.032% to +1.534%

Statistical Test:
  H0: Mean return = 0
  t-statistic: 0.495
  p-value: 0.624 (two-sided)
  ✗ NOT significant (α=0.05)

INTERPRETATION: Despite hostile language, Aggressive tweets do NOT cause
market drops. If anything, they show a slight positive bias.

---

DEFENSIVE TWEETS (N=9)
----------------------
• Mean 30-min return: -0.015%
• 66.7% had POSITIVE reactions
• Only 33.3% had negative reactions
• Standard deviation: 0.101%
• Range: -0.192% to +0.127%

Statistical Test:
  H0: Mean return = 0
  t-statistic: -0.455
  p-value: 0.661 (two-sided)
  ✗ NOT significant (α=0.05)

INTERPRETATION: Defensive tweets (justifying tariffs) show nearly zero
impact. Small sample size limits statistical power.

---

INFORMATIONAL TWEETS (N=38)
---------------------------
• Mean 30-min return: -0.079%
• 52.6% had NEGATIVE reactions
• Only 44.7% had positive reactions
• Standard deviation: 0.289%
• Range: -1.321% to +0.311%

Statistical Test:
  H0: Mean return = 0
  t-statistic: -1.685
  p-value: 0.101 (two-sided)
  p-value: 0.0502 (one-sided, negative)
  ✗ NOT significant (α=0.05) - but VERY CLOSE

INTERPRETATION: Informational tweets show the MOST negative reactions,
barely missing statistical significance. Possible that factual announcements
(e.g., "tariffs now in effect") carry more market weight than rhetoric.

================================================================================
PAIRWISE COMPARISONS
================================================================================

None of the sentiment types differ significantly from each other:

  Aggressive vs Defensive:      p = 0.727 (NO difference)
  Aggressive vs Informational:  p = 0.162 (NO difference)
  Defensive vs Informational:   p = 0.520 (NO difference)

The 0.109% difference between Aggressive (+0.030%) and Informational
(-0.079%) is the largest, but still not statistically significant.

CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

1. **NO EVIDENCE of sentiment-driven market reactions**
   - All three sentiment types show near-zero mean returns
   - None are statistically significant
   - Magnitude of reactions is tiny (all within ±0.08%)

2. **Aggressive tweets do NOT cause market drops**
   - Mean return is actually slightly positive (+0.030%)
   - 61.5% of Aggressive tweets had positive 30-min reactions
   - This contradicts the common narrative

3. **Informational tweets show weakest reactions**
   - Mean return of -0.079% (most negative)
   - 52.6% had negative reactions
   - Barely misses significance (p=0.0502)
   - Suggests factual announcements may have more impact than rhetoric

4. **Individual variation is HIGH**
   - Returns range from -1.321% to +1.534%
   - Standard deviations (0.1-0.4%) much larger than mean effects
   - Individual tweet content matters more than sentiment category

5. **Sample size matters**
   - Aggressive: 39 events (good statistical power)
   - Informational: 38 events (good statistical power)
   - Defensive: 9 events (limited power, results less reliable)

IMPLICATIONS FOR TRADING STRATEGY
================================================================================

❌ DO NOT trade based on tariff tweet sentiment alone:
   - Effects are too small (< 0.1% on average)
   - High variance (±0.3-0.4%) drowns out any signal
   - No statistically significant patterns

❌ "Buy the dip after Aggressive tweets" strategy is NOT viable:
   - Aggressive tweets don't cause dips (mean = +0.030%)
   - Only 38.5% are negative
   - No statistical edge

⚠️  Informational tweets may warrant attention:
   - Show most negative bias (-0.079%)
   - Nearly significant (p=0.0502)
   - Could become tradeable with larger sample or refinement

✅  Better approach:
   - Focus on individual tweet content, not sentiment labels
   - Look for specific policy announcements (effective dates, percentages)
   - Combine with other market signals
   - Use longer time horizons (days/weeks, not 30 minutes)
